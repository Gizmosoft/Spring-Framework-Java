[A] JSR-330 - Dependency Injection for Java
Alternative DI annotations
Spring is valid JSR-330 implementation
	@ComponentScan also scans for JSR-330 annotations
	
	@Inject for injecting dependencies 
		Provides subset of @Autowired functionality, but often is enough
		unlike @Autowired it Always required
	
	@Named - Alternative to @Component 
		can be used With or without bean name - @Named / @Named("beanName")
		Default scope is "prototype"
		But InSide Spring Container Always Scope is Singleton

	@Singleton - instead of @Named for singleton scoped beans
	
	
we can mix JSR330 annotations with Spring Annotations Autowiered or StereoType Annotations.
